This project implements a Just-In-Time (JIT) Store simulation using an M/M/1 queue model.
The store processes orders arriving based on a Poisson distribution,
with each order being produced following an exponential service time.
The simulation analyzes key performance metrics to evaluate the efficiency of the JIT store.

Installation.
Install the required Python packages:
pip install simpy matplotlib numpy

Dependencies.
The following Python libraries are required:
simpy: For discrete-event simulation
numpy: For generating exponential and Poisson distributions
matplotlib: For plotting graphs
